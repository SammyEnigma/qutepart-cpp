## Qutepart and Katepart
[Kate](http://kate-editor.org/) and Katepart (an editor component) is really cool software. The Kate authors and community have created, probably, the biggest set of highlighters and indenters for programming languages.

* Qutepart uses Kate syntax highlighters (XML files)
* Qutepart contains a port from Javascript to C++ of Kate indenters
* Qutepart doesn't contain Katepart code.

Nothing is wrong with Katepart. Qutepart has been created to enable reusing highlighters and indenters in projects where a KDE dependency is not acceptable.

## License
LGPL v2

I don't mind if you use the code under WTFPL license. But consult you layers if I have right to release it this way.
